# dataScieceBasics
This repo demonstrates that I have done basic data science techniques in both Python and R. These two folders explore the multiple data sets. Some of the exploration involves finding high perfroming stores to the most impacted airports! All the way to voter information etc. These demonstrate graphs, statistics, and much more!
